Essential Components of CBT
CBT contains several essential components that contribute to its effectiveness in therapy. These components are:

Cognitive Restructuring: This component involves identifying and challenging negative or maladaptive thoughts and beliefs. By examining the evidence for and against these thoughts, individuals can replace them with more balanced and helpful alternatives.

Behavioral Activation: Behavioral activation focuses on increasing engagement in activities that promote positive emotions and well-being. It encourages individuals to overcome avoidance or withdrawal behaviors, leading to increased motivation, pleasure, and fulfillment.

Exposure and Response Prevention: Exposure therapy involves gradually exposing individuals to feared or avoided situations or stimuli. By doing so, it helps individuals confront and reduce their anxiety or distress. Response prevention involves preventing individuals from engaging in their usual anxiety-driven responses, allowing them to learn new, healthier coping mechanisms.

Skills Training: CBT often includes teaching individuals various coping skills, such as relaxation techniques, problem-solving strategies, and assertiveness training. These skills enhance individuals' ability to manage stress, regulate emotions, and navigate challenging situations effectively.


- create a category called morning message
- this category will be where you will configure your message

- The system checks hourly. To set the time, add an entry as below:
  time: 6
  if you want the message to go out at 6AM
- to add a whole category to the message, add an entry as below:
  category: todo
  this will add your entire todo list to the message
- to add a random entry from one of your categories, type:
  random: quotes
  this will display a random entry from your quotes list
- To enter a message that doesn't change, type:
  text: Morning Your Highness

An example configuration:
# morning message
1. text: Morning your Highness
2. category: todo
3. random: quotes
4. text: Thats all for today. Have a great day.
